Installing Stoq
===================

To install stoqlib, just type:

  python setup.py install

This will install Stoq in the same directory as you have Python
installed in. On most Unix systems this means /usr. However, if you
don't have write access to this directory or if you simply want to
install Stoq in another directory, type the following:

  python setup.py install --prefix DIRECTORY

Where DIRECTORY is the directory you want to install it to.
