Patching the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Naming convention
-----------------

All database patches follows the pattern:
    patch-XX-YY.ZZ (example: patch-00-10.sql)

where:

    XX: indicates the generation. Example: 00
    YY: indicates the patch level. Example: 01
    ZZ: indicates the file extension. Example: sql

The generation number is used to know which patches we should apply in order
to take an old database to the latest version available.
The patch level is also used to update the database, so we will be able to
apply the patches in the correct order.

There are two extensions available for database patches:
    - sql: containing pure SQL commands (DDL & DML)
    -  py: a python script which receives an Transaction in order to modify the
           database objects (see one patch*.py for an example)

Changing the database generation
--------------------------------

- Updating the schema:
You will need to update schema (named schema-X.sql) in order to include all
the changes of the latest generations. This will ensure that a created
database using this schema will be similar to a updated one.

- Creating generation mark:
Just create an empty file named patch-XX-00.sql.
Where XX indicates the new generation.
